[2025-11-20 15:24:09] ROBOT_SPEECH: There once was a girl known as Little Red Riding Hood. and she always wore a red riding cape wherever she went.
[2025-11-20 15:24:14] ROBOT_SPEECH: One day, she decided to go visit her dear grandmother, who lift deep in the woods.
[2025-11-20 15:24:23] ROBOT_SPEECH: When her mother packed a basket of treats,  she warned her not to talk to strangers along the way.
[2025-11-20 15:24:24] ROBOT_SPEECH: As Little Red Riding Hood happily strolled through the woods,   she did not notice the sneaky wolf stalking her through the trees.
[2025-11-20 15:24:25] ROBOT_SPEECH: The wolf, pretending to be lost, asked Little Red Riding Hood for directions.
[2025-11-20 15:24:26] ROBOT_SPEECH: The wolf seemed harmless enough, so Little Red Riding Hood not only spoke to him.   She also revealed where she was going.
[2025-11-20 15:24:27] ROBOT_SPEECH: The wolf rushed ahead to beat her to her grand mother’s house,   gaining entry by pretending to be her dear granddaughter. 
[2025-11-20 15:24:28] ROBOT_SPEECH: Having locked her grandmother in the closet,  the wolf waited for Little Red Riding Hood to arrive.
[2025-11-20 15:24:29] ROBOT_SPEECH: When she knocked on her grandmother’s door, she was greeted by a strange voice.  “Come in dear,” said the wolf. 
[2025-11-20 15:24:30] ROBOT_SPEECH: As the wolf lay in bed, wearing one of her grandmother’s nightgowns, Little Red Riding Hood thought her grandmother sounded and looked strange. 
[2025-11-20 15:24:38] ROBOT_SPEECH: all done
[2025-11-20 15:26:01] ROBOT_SPEECH: What big ears you have, she said. Better to hear you with my dear, replied the wolf. 
[2025-11-20 15:26:25] ROBOT_SPEECH: “What big eyes you have,” said Little Red Riding Hood.  “Better to see you with my darling,” the wolf replied. 
[2025-11-20 15:26:28] ROBOT_SPEECH: Your teeth, your teeth are large and as sharp as knives.  Little Red Riding Hood exclaimed.
[2025-11-20 15:26:30] ROBOT_SPEECH: “The better to eat you with!” growled the wolf as he jumped up and lunged at the girl.
[2025-11-20 15:26:33] ROBOT_SPEECH: Luckily Little Red Riding Hood had practiced self defense, and grabbed a broom to fend off the wolf. Surprised by the girl's bravery, the wolf ran off with his tail between his legs.
[2025-11-20 15:26:34] ROBOT_SPEECH: Little Red Riding Hood freed her grandmother from the closet,  and her grandmother made Little Red Riding Hood promise not to talk to strangers ever again.
