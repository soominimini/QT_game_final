[2025-12-05 15:06:38] ROBOT_SPEECH: The wolf seemed harmless enough, so Little Red Riding Hood not only spoke to him.   She also revealed where she was going.
[2025-12-05 15:07:12] ROBOT_SPEECH: The wolf rushed ahead to beat her to her grand mother’s house,   gaining entry by pretending to be her dear granddaughter.
