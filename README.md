# QT Robot Educational Game Platform

A comprehensive Flask-based web application designed for the QT Robot that provides interactive educational games, storytelling experiences, and emotion recognition activities for children of different age groups.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project creates an interactive educational platform where the QT Robot can engage with children through various games, stories, and activities. The system uses computer vision (ArUco markers), real-time communication (WebSocket), and robot control interfaces to create immersive learning experiences.


## üìù Notes

- The application is specifically designed for the QT Robot platform
- ROS integration is essential for full functionality
- Web interface works independently for testing
- User data is stored locally in text files
- All robot interactions are logged for analysis

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (Flask + Socket.IO)
- **Flask**: Web framework for HTTP routes and template rendering
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **ROS Integration**: Robot control and sensor data processing
- **Threading**: Concurrent speech, gesture, and audio processing

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive UI framework
- **jQuery**: DOM manipulation and AJAX requests
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time communication with backend

### Computer Vision

- **Real-time Processing**: Live camera feed analysis

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- ROS (Robot Operating System) - for robot functionality
- OpenCV
- Flask and related dependencies

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure ROS is properly configured (for robot deployment)
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Can run on Windows with mock ROS packages for web interface testing
- **Production**: Requires Linux with full ROS installation for robot functionality

## üìä User Data and Logging

The system automatically logs user interactions:
- User login/logout events
- Game selections and progress
- Robot speech and responses
- User actions and choices
- Session timestamps and duration

Logs are stored in `user_files/` with format: `{username}_{session_number}.txt`
