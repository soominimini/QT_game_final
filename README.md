- Speech recognition and response

### Gestures and Emotions
- Idle gesture animations
- Emotion expression display
- Context-aware gesture selection
- Interactive gesture responses

### Computer Vision
- ArUco marker detection for card recognition
- Real-time camera feed processing
- Object and action recognition

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend (Flask + Socket.IO)
- **Flask**: Web framework for HTTP routes and template rendering
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **ROS Integration**: Robot control and sensor data processing
- **Threading**: Concurrent speech, gesture, and audio processing

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive UI framework
- **jQuery**: DOM manipulation and AJAX requests
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time communication with backend

### Computer Vision
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and ArUco marker detection
- **ArUco Markers**: Physical card recognition system
- **Real-time Processing**: Live camera feed analysis

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- ROS (Robot Operating System) - for robot functionality
- OpenCV
- Flask and related dependencies

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Ensure ROS is properly configured (for robot deployment)
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Can run on Windows with mock ROS packages for web interface testing
- **Production**: Requires Linux with full ROS installation for robot functionality

## üìä User Data and Logging

The system automatically logs user interactions:
- User login/logout events
- Game selections and progress
- Robot speech and responses
- User actions and choices
- Session timestamps and duration

Logs are stored in `user_files/` with format: `{username}_{session_number}.txt`

## üéØ Target Audience

### Young Children (Ages 3-6)
- Basic emotion recognition
- Simple action games
- Interactive stories with visual elements
- Physical activities (dice games)

### Older Children (Ages 7-12)
- Advanced emotion scenarios
- Complex reasoning games
- Interactive storytelling with choices
- Educational question-answer activities

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Games
1. Create game logic in a new Python module
2. Add corresponding HTML template
3. Implement Socket.IO handlers in `main.py`
4. Add game assets to `static/images/`

### Modifying Robot Behavior
- Adjust gesture timing in game modules
- Modify speech patterns in Socket.IO handlers
- Update emotion expressions in robot control functions

### Adding New Stories
1. Create story pages in `templates/`
2. Implement story logic with character interactions
3. Add story assets to `static/images/story/`
4. Update story selection interface

## üìù Notes

- The application is designed for the QT Robot platform
- ROS integration is essential for full functionality
- Web interface works independently for testing
- User data is stored locally in text files
- All robot interactions are logged for analysis
